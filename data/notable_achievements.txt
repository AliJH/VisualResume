12	Working closely with the Solution Architect and I have lead the initial implementation of WMQ's first data warehouse (based on Azure Synapse Analytics and following a metadata driven approach). With the first suite of production ready Power BI reports available to the business within 4 months.
12	I have contributed to extending and refactoring the data warehouse platform adding functionality to better handle data sources based around API connectivity (using Azure Logic Apps for integration between Azure Synapse Analytics and the data source) and non-tabular data formats (e.g. JSON and XML).
5	Development of PowerShell scripts to extract eDOCS usage data and load it into SharePoint lists for consumption by custom visualisations built using Chart.js (yes it was hacky but it also saved days of manual work every month and introduced me to the wonderful world of data).
5	Development of a custom reporting layer for Bing Maps (it was a better price than Google Maps and met our requirements) that visualises the 100+ statewide offices supported by the Record Management team showing key usage data alongside supporting information (e.g. network connectivity, some sites have limited connectivity which could make regular use of the departmental record keeping system unfeasible).
5	Development of PowerShell scripts that use the eDOCS DM API to facilitate data migrations into eDOCS. These scripts enable the Records Management team to directly oversee regular migrations of key records into the departmental records management system without having to pay for vendor support hours.
6	In response to the rapidly changing impact of COVID19 on the QLD judicial system I refactored Courts ELT processes from being monthly batch jobs to daily incremental loads. This involved working closely with IT project teams to implement the departmentâ€™s first Azure based data solution which facilitated the creation of Power BI Dashboards designed to provide decision makers with timely data improving their ability to make informed decisions in a rapidly changing environment.
6	Working closely with senior analysts I lead the technical development of a suite of datasets designed to support dashboards highlighting the progression of matters before the Childrens Court of Queensland (CCQ). These datasets combined data from multiple disparate systems and made use of statistical linkage keys to attempt to identify unique individuals across these systems. The resulting reports are used by Judiciary and their support staff to easily get a view of matters before the CCQ. Facilitating performance measurement of individual process areas, identifying opportunities for improvement. With improved performance of the courts matters can be dealt with promptly granting participants an earlier resolution to what is often a very stressful time.
6	I created the first automated, centralised report that showed the number of court events listed at each courthouse within Queensland. This report took the form of a SAS Visual Analytics report (with a somewhat hacky (but you use what you have, and it sure beat manual extracts from multiple business systems and collation in Excel by each individual courthouse) matrix visual made up to look like a wall calendar). Creating this report required me to combine and standardise data from multiple line of business systems. I then worked closely with my Manager to analyse historical trends so that we could provide guidelines per courthouse of what was likely to constitute a busy or quiet period. These guidelines were embedded within the report as visual indicators making it easier for staff to identify upcoming days that events could be listed on without compromising public safety due to over scheduling.
